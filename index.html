                                            <p>This book is a very good book! But since it is a world history book, it is OPTIONAl if you are a member of the SSA. It gives SO MUCH information about the history of the world! I hightly recomend this book to anyone! You can buy this book at amazon.com and an any bookstore that is there nearby!
